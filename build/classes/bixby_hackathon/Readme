# The project contains two java file 'Bixby_hackathon.java' & 'Utils.java'
1. Change the input file path in 'Bixby_hackathon.java'
2. Change the output file path in 'Utils.java'

# To execute program run 'java Bixby_hackathon'

# Our proposed approach consist of two modules
a) Similarity comparison when both words are in 'Hindi'
b) Similarity comparison when one words is in 'Hindi' and the other in 'English' 

# For module1 we have used  'Soundex' algorithm and for second we have created our own custom dictionary.
